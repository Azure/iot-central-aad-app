# An interactive code walk-through on how to authenticate and authorize to use the Azure IoT Central REST APIs
This is a small codebase built from create-react-app and uses MSAL.js. The code demonstrates the call patterns required to Auth'N/Auth'Z against MS Graph, IoT Central, Azure Resource Management (ARM) and working examples of their respective APIs. This should provide you with enough base code to start your own application.
